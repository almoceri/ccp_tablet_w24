                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Cinisi is a small town in northweatern Sicily. It also happens to be the hometown of my Grandfather and my Uncle. It consisits of one large street running down the center (corso Umberto),
                    with a few side streets branching off. The surrounding area is very hilly, and the town itself is on a slight incline. At the top of the incline and at 
                    the end of the main street, is the piazza and the main church, La Chiesa Madre di Santa Fara.

                <h3>Description</h3>

                <p>Cefalu is a small town on the coast of northcentral Sicily. The town runs far along the coast, with a long, thin beach acoompanying it.
                The town has a all brick, thin roads. Roads so thin and packed with people that you'd expect a car to not be able to traverse it. This was not the case 
                however, as cars would try their best to manuver through the city, dodging people and shops along the way. The town also possesees a large piazza with a large church overlooking it.
                This piazza is stuffed with differemt cafes, restuarants, bakeries and bars.
